### Hi there 👋. I'm [Katolus](https://twitter.com/Katolinho). 

I enjoy building tools to help me satisfy my **curiosity** 🌕 and experience 🌀. 

I'm interested in Data and Machine Engineering, IoT devices and human behaviour.

Go-to stack involves: 
- **Python** as the programming language of choice. 
- **GCP** as a hosting platform of choice.
- **VSCode** as the editor.
- **Ubuntu** as the OS.

I'm currently working on: 
 - [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) setup for a local network.
 - A Python package called `functions-cli` that is built to interface with major FaaS offerings.

I'm currently researching:
- Open Source projects and communities.
- Computer Architecture, Internet Protocols and Encryption.
- Electrical Circuits and Material Science.
- Statistics.

You can ask me questions about **_interesting things_**.

I would love to collaborate on projects resolving around **health** or **physics**.

You can reach me by writing me an **email** or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotr-katolik/) message. 

Have a good ... no have a **great** day.
